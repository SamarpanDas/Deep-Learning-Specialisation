# Deep-Learning-Specialisation
My personal notes focusing on the Deep Learning Specialisation that I am currently doing from Coursera.

I am currently on my way through the Deep Learning Specialisation and am posting it hoping these notes will be able to provide insight to the people wanting to know about Deep Learning.
These files are entirely my personal belongings and I am posting these online solely for educational purposes. 
These are high quality materials and I believe that one going through these will surely benefit
